        <h3>CTM (Custom Texture Mod) Functionality</h3>
        <h4>Naming Conventions</h4>
        <p>
            Firstly, naming convention:<br>
            For CTM textures, you don't have to follow the vanilla naming conventions.
            For the sake of ease, I chose to refer to my textures numerically, beginning with <code>0.png</code>, being the base (vanilla) texture.
            This is useful, because a) you provide better readability in the respective <code>.properties</code> files and b) you can refer to multiple textures without having to write out the name of every single one of them (more on that later).
            For the <code>.properties</code> files, I name them after the function they're meant to serve, so if I provide a <code>.properties</code> file that's responsible for changing the bottom texture of a Brick double slab, I call the <code>.properties</code> file <code>bricks_doubleslab_bottom.properties</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In principle, though, you can follow any naming convention that you see fit, so long as you refer to the texture names correctly in the <code>.properties</code> files.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/documentation/naming_conventions.png" alt="Naming Conventions" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:10px;">

        <h4><code>.properties</code> Files</h4>
        <p>
            Now. You have created your textures and now you want OptiFine to recognize and use them. This is achieved through text files with a .properties extension, as long as it's utilized properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>matchBlocks</b><br>
            Firstly, you'll need to tell the file which tile (block), you want to change the texture for.
            This is achieved with the matchBlocks function.
            I'm told that matchTiles works aswell, but so far, working with matchBlocks has held no negative effects for me.
            If someone knows a measurable difference between the two, I'll reflect that in future.
            For the sake of avoiding misunderstandings, I'd recommend always refering to the wanted block in full, so <code>modname:blockname</code>, achieving something that looks like this:
            <div class="custom-code-block">matchBlocks=minecraft:brick_block
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>metadata</b><br>
            Next, since you can't refer to specific metadata, using just <code>matchBlocks</code>, you will have to do this in a secondary step.
            If you don't know what "Metadata" is, they are the predecessor to the later "Blockstates" and define different iterations of the same block.
            For example, if a stair block is rotated to the left or right, a slab is turned upside-down or if a mossy stone brick is used instead of a regular one, the metadata reflects that.
            If you don't know all metadata by heart (why would you, ever?), I recommend using <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waila">WAILA</a> or something similar to find out the metadata of the block you're looking at in-game.<br>
            Following our example from above, if we refer to a brick block of the metadata of 0, it would look like this:
            <div class="custom-code-block">matchBlocks=minecraft:brick_block
                metadata=0
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that some seriously cursed stuff is achieved through metadata, which, on the one hand, makes you immensely powerful when dealing with textures, for example allowing you do differentiate between normal and upside-down slabs with completely different textures, but it also leads to some things being unchangable, like the side textures of doors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>faces</b><br>
            Because you don't always want to change all sides of a block into the same textures, CTM allows for you to specify every single texture as you see fit.
            This is achieved through the <code>faces</code> command. You can use the following methods here:
            <ul>
                <li><code>faces=all</code> (Changes all textures on a block.)</li>
                <li><code>faces=sides</code> (Changes all side textures on a block.)</li>
                <li><code>faces=top</code> (Changes the top texture on a block.)</li>
                <li><code>faces=bottom</code> (Changes the bottom texture on a block.)</li>
                <li><code>faces=north</code> (Changes the northern texture on a block (check the F3 screen).)</li>
                <li><code>faces=south</code> (Changes the southern texture on a block.)</li>
                <li><code>faces=east</code> (Changes the eastern texture on a block.)</li>
                <li><code>faces=west</code> (Changes the western texture on a block.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This function is necessary to change "face textures" for blocks that follow the player's facing direction when being placed, like Pumpkins or Furnaces.
            A combination of <code>metadata</code> and <code>faces</code> has to be employed for this to work.
            This is the reason for a lot of texture folders looking like this, because you generally cannot assign different textures in one file.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/documentation/folder_structure.png" alt="Folder Structure" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:10px;">
        <p>
            For every side of the block that you want the texture to change, and for every state of the block you want this change to apply to, you'll have to make a new file, which can lead to something like the picture below.
            You <b>can</b> refer to multiple meta values or faces in one file, but only if you want to apply the same texture to them.<br>
            Following our example, if we want to change all faces, it would look like this:
            <div class="custom-code-block">matchBlocks=minecraft:brick_block
                metadata=0
                faces=all
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>tiles</b><br>
            Next, you will have to assign your created textures to this <code>.properties</code> file, using the <code>tiles</code> command.
            You can refer to every texture that you created and put into this folder, but if you named them in numeric order, you can summarize them using <code>-</code>.
            The following configurations are possible:
            <ul>
                <li><code>tiles=bricks_topside bricks_topside2 bricks_topside3</code> (If you named your textures.)</li>
                <li><code>tiles=0</code> (If only one texture is present.)</li>
                <li><code>tiles=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</code> (If you want to write them all out.)</li>
                <li><code>tiles=0 1 2 7 8 10</code> (If you don't want to use all provided textures.)</li>
                <li><code>tiles=0-10</code> (If you want to summarize the textures.)</li>
                <li><code>tiles=0-2 7-9 10</code> (If you want to summarize, but don't want to use all provided textures.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Following our example, if we have 25 textures to assign to our brick block, it would look like this:<br>
            <div class="custom-code-block">matchBlocks=minecraft:brick_block
                metadata=0
                faces=all
                tiles=0-24
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>weights</b><br>
            This function is used to define how the textures are being distributed, in terms of frequency.
            Weight always works like this:<br>
            If you have 5 textures, that have the weights of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, texture one will be distributed 1 out of (1+2+3+4+5=15) times.
            The weights don't have to add up to 100, we're not talking percentages (even though, if calculated, you could very well make out a percentage of how many times a certain texture will appear, according to its weight, but I think you get the point).<br>
            Keep in mind that you have to specify a weight value for every single texture file that you're adding, in the order they are specified in the tiles function.<br>
            Following our example, if we weight our textures differently, it would look like this:<br>
            <div class="custom-code-block">matchBlocks=minecraft:brick_block
                metadata=0
                faces=all
                tiles=0-24
                weights=4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>method</b><br>
            This function is the most important of all the ones you've seen so far.
            It defines how exactly your texture will be used, and different methods use or don't use the functions that I presented before.
            The following methods are known to work:
            <ul>
                <li><code>method=fixed</code> (This will only apply one single texture, all the time. It will only accept one tile being present in the <code>tiles</code> command and will ignore weights.)</li>
                <li><code>method=random</code> (This command uses all the textures that are defined in <code>tiles</code>, weigh them in accordance with the <code>weights</code> function and distribute them randomly. This can also used for texture rotation, if the textures provided are rotated versions of the original texture <code>0.png</code>.)</li>
                <li><code>method=ctm</code> (This command is the most complex of the lot, requiring 47 different textures to be present for it to work. It's primarily used to achieve features like connected glass and similar ideas. For this to work, the textures <b>have</b> to be named numerically, and they have to be created according to the template provided below.)</li>
                <li><code>method=horizontal</code> (This command requires 4 textures, named in numerical fashion and created according to the template below. It's used to make textures connect when the blocks are placed next to each other horizontally.)</li>
                <li><code>method=vertical</code> (This command works the same as <code>horizontal</code>, but for vertical connection.)</li>
                <li><code>method=top</code> (This command is used to connect only to the block above (I don't quite know how this works yet).)</li>
                <li><code>method=repeat</code> (This command can be used to achieve even greater randomization. You define a texture that's larger than a normal block texture and this function will repeat a fixed pattern defined in said texture over multiple blocks.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="assets/documentation/ctm_template.png" alt="CTM Template" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; margin-top:10px;">
        <p>
            Following our example and giving it the random method, it would look like this:<br>
            <div class="custom-code-block">matchBlocks=minecraft:brick_block
                metadata=0
                faces=all
                tiles=0-24
                weights=4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1
                method=random
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>biomes</b><br>
            This function is used to change block textures depending on the biome the block gets placed in.
            It is important to note that, currently, you can only assign multiple textures to different biomes, if one of them is specifically made out to apply to <b>all other</b> biomes.
            The biome naming conventions are a bit strange in some cases, which is why a complete list of the accepted biome names will be provided below.
            For non-vanilla biomes, it's generally enough to remove the spaces in the middle of biome names to reference them in a <code>.properties</code> file.
            Also, keep in mind that, as with all other functions biomes do not get seperated by <code>,</code>!<br>
