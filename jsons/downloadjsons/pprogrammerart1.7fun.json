For this to function, you need to go the `.minecraft/assets/skins/23` directory. In there you will find a file whose name consists of a large string of numbers and letters and that has no file name extension. To manipulate this file, you'll need to rename it to add `.png` on the end, after which it becomes an editable image file. Add (NOT replace with) the downloaded texture to the file you just opened in an image editing software and save it. Afterwards, remove the `.png` extension from the file again and it should work in game.}",
