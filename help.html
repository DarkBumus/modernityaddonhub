    <h2>Help</h2>
<p>
    If you clicked on this button, chances are high that you're in need of help with setting up your Modernity Addon texture pack. Not to worry. While this service is not as "plug and play" as Vanilla Tweaks is, setting up a pack has still been made much easier than actually creating a whole texture pack, so don't you worry about that.
</p>
    <h2>Before getting started</h2>
<p>
    Most of the content that is presented on this website requires some type of outside help, especially the content that is designed for older versions, as Minecraft, generally speaking, isn't able to display these features just with normal resource packs.<br>
    For that reason, before getting started, you will likely have to make one or more downloads. In the unlikely case that you don't know how mods for Minecraft are installed, here is a quick guide:
</p>
<p>
    > Download the mod loader of your choice and Minecraft version. Most popular are probably <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/" target="_blank">Forge</a>
    or <a href="https://fabricmc.net/" target="_blank">Fabric</a>.
    Run the mod loader according to their respective instructions.<br>
    > Download a mod (<b>ONLY FROM TRUSTWORTHY SOURCES</b>, like Curseforge, Modrinth or the self-hosted websites. If you're unsure if a site is trustworthy, feel free to ask on the Discord server.<br>
    > The mod should come in a Java Archive Format, meaning the file extension should be <code>.jar</code>. If it is anything other than a <code>.jar</code> or a <code>.zip</code>, especially if it's an <code>.exe</code>, <b>DO NOT RUN IT</b>.<br>
    > Place the mod <code>.jar</code> into the <code>.minecraft/mods</code> folder.<br>
    > If necessary, head to <code>.minecraft/config</code> and change the configuration options for your mod.<br>
    > Run the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
    For most of the content features here, you will need one or multiple mods. In most versions, <a href="https://optifine.net/downloads" target="_blank">OptiFine</a>
    is needed, however in Minecraft 1.7.10, that functionality has been ported to <a href="https://github.com/vfx-dev/Right-Proper-MCPatcher" target="_blank">Right Proper MCPatcher</a>.
    While OptiFine exists for 1.7.10 aswell, Modernity Addon Hub does not encourage its use.
</p>
    <h2>Making a pack</h2>
<p>
    Now that your installation is ready, the first thing any resource pack needs is a vessel in which to place the textures. For the sake of simplicity, I have decided to provide a shell and detailed instructions on how to fill it with content.<br>
    In every version tab, you will find a 'Templates' Panel, which houses a Texture Pack <code>.zip</code> file for the respective pack and version. It's filled with a <code>pack.png</code> and a <code>pack.mcmeta</code> file. Neither need to be touched by you. Instead, navigate to the <code>assets\minecraft</code> folder. In there you can dump the <code>mcpatcher</code> or <code>textures</code> or <code>sounds</code> or <code>lang</code> folders from your <b>Addons</b>.<br>
    When downloading an <b>Addon</b> from below, you will receive a <code>.zip</code> file that has a folder with the respective <code>.png</code> and <code>.properties</code> files in it. To make use of your selected Addons, open the downloaded Template Resource Pack <code>.zip</code> file and drag the Addon folder from the Addon <code>.zip</code> file into <code>assets\minecraft</code>.<br>
    Afterwards, place the now edited Resource Pack '.zip' file into your resource pack folder (usually '.minecraft\resourcepacks'), start the game and select it in the Resource Pack menu. Have fun!<br>
    <b>Keep in mind: Changing your mod loadout <i>can</i> break the mod-related Addons in all worlds that have existed before!</b>. This is presumably due to the way numerical IDs are assigned to blocks and items in older versions.<br>
    Some <b>Addons</b>, specifically those with the "🍦 Vanilla-compatible" tag, don't require OptiFine, MCPatcher or any other similar mod.<br>
    Should problems arise, don't be shy to ask questions on the helpdesk on the Discord server! :)
